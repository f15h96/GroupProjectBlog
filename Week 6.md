## Week 6 Blog

### Thursday - 1 hour
during the meeting today, we discussed the roles of all of us for the design document and that we should get started on it there I was also tasked to get the UI document to be up to standard in reflection to Chris's comments

### Wednesday - 1.5 hours
we did not meet up today as there was not too much for us to discuss
I have started making the sequence diagrams and will have at least one done by the meeting tomorrow however I have not had time to do the update on the UI document and will make sure to get it done next week.
