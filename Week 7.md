## Week 7 Blog

### Sunday - 2 hours
Today I did the changes to the UI doc to reflect Chris's comments.I changed the typical users to make it a real user, I removed the pause menu as it was an added feature which is unnecessary and I also changed the error conditions. I also made the sequence diagrams for the design document.

### Monday - 2 hours
We met up today without Agata who had work to discuss the UI document and the testing document to review them again after the changes that Chris suggested had been made. The UI doc had to change the typical users slightly but otherwise it was fine. The testing document needed some clarification to get it finished but otherwise it was good. We also discussed the design document and we looked at all the work we have done on it to see how close we were to finishing the document. My sequence diagrams needed to be more specific and needed more information in it so I will get them done by Wednesday. Some of us had finished their work and some needed more information from other group members to get their work done so we decided to meet on Wednesday to put all our work together in the document.

### Tuesday - 1 hours
I have created the more specific sequence diagrams and will show them to the group on Wednesday.

### Wednesday- 1 hour
Today we met up however Emily could not meet as she had a doctors appointment however we added all the work that everyone had done into the design document and now we have a first draft of the document.
