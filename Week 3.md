## Week 3 Blog

### Thursday - 1 hour
this week I was assigned during the meeting to look into javafx and also Phil told us some coding jobs that we should look into one of them was looking into how to best load the dictionary in and lookup the words submitted.

### Weekend - 1 hour
I looked into the javafx on the weekend and looked at how to do some basic coding of the UI in java however I couldnâ€™t find the scene builder I was told about.

### Monday and Tuesday - 2 hours
I decided to look into how to do the dictionary lookup, the way I decided to do this is by using a hash map using the first letters as the key to the map and using a binary search to look through the words with that first letter to find the word submitted.

### Wednesday - 1 hour
We all met up and decided on the roles of everyone and it was decided that Emily will be QA manager and Conor will be deputy QA manager, Alex will be the project leader and Aaron will be deputy project leader and we also made sure everyone had done what they were supposed to do. I also uploaded how much I had done of the hash map code.
