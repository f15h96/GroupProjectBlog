## Week 4 Blog

### Thursday - 1 hour
this week I was assigned during the meeting to do the User interface document along with Conor.

### Monday and Tuesday - 3 hours
I created the document and I layed it out to the specification in the QA04 document and I wrote the Typical Users section and the Use Cases section with the use of Peter's Use Cases I then handed the document over to Conor to complete it.

### Wednesday - 3 hours
We all met up and went over what everyone had done and then we reviewed both the Testing and the User interface documents during the review we found issues with the documents and we have noted the issues and will fix them by the submission tomorrow.
