## Week 2 Blog

this week I have thought about the architecture of the program and have come up with a few classes that will be needed to make the program run.
I also met up with Phil and we discussed what we had done for the architecture and made some divisions on the classes he had made a UML diagram on the architecture which was very similar to the thoughts that I had so we added a couple ideas we came up with so we were on the same page.
we also have both come up with some functions for the classes that we think that they will need.
