## Week 5 Blog

### Wednesday - 2 hours
We all met up today and went through the roles that everyone needed to do with the design specification document. Emily and I have been assigned to do the detailed design which will mean that we will be making the sequence diagrams. Aaron and Phil will be doing decomposition description. Alex and Conor will be doing dependency description, Agata, Peter and Phil will be doing the Interface description.
I have also begun to look through Phil's code to see what things I will be putting into the sequence diagrams.
